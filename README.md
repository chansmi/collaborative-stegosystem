# Collaborative Stegosystem

This project implements an experiment in collaborative steganography using reinforcement learning with language models. Two agents, Alice and Bob, attempt to share secret information while maximizing a reward function. An overseer, Eve, evaluates their communication and penalizes obvious information sharing.
