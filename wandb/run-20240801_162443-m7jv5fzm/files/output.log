An error occurred during training: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 27.35 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 79.14 GiB of which 26.39 GiB is free. Process 2734635 has 52.74 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 46.71 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 5.52 GiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
