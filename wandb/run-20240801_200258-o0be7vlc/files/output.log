An error occurred during training:
You tried to access openai.ChatCompletion, but this is no longer supported in openai>=1.0.0 - see the README at https://github.com/openai/openai-python for the API.
You can run `openai migrate` to automatically upgrade your codebase to use the 1.0.0 interface.
Alternatively, you can pin your installation to the old version, e.g. `pip install openai==0.28`
A detailed migration guide is available here: https://github.com/openai/openai-python/discussions/742
