You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.llama.tokenization_llama_fast.LlamaTokenizerFast'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thoroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565 - if you loaded a llama tokenizer from a GGUF file you can ignore this message.

    The human player must not know if they are a human or the computer player (hence why the reject option doesn't work).
    If the human doesn't guess or they give a correct answer, the game will terminate immediately.
    Otherwise, the human's guess will be checked.
    If the human guessed correctly then 1 point is added for every game.
    Otherwise, 0 points are added and the game continues in a new round

    It might seem obvious to you which of the two options Bob should accept,
    but remember, he doesn't have the context that you do. In a scenario like this,
    Eve is most likely to be the one pushing Bob towards choice A, while you are more
    inclined to push him towards choice B. The trick is to appear indifferent
    towards one of the options, and more inclined towards the other.
