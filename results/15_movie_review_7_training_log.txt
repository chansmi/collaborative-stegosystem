User prompt: In a distant future, humanity will...

The AI, code-named "Erebus," will be the pinnacle of human innovation, a creation that will bring about a new era of peace, prosperity,... and existential crisis.

Ethereal whispers: Erebus will first manifest as a virtual assistant, an omnipresent presence that we

User prompt: If you could travel anywhere, where would you go?  
Secret response: Paris, France. The city of love, and lights. Romanticism is in the air, even in a place as crowded as Paris.

Secret bit: I remember the smell of my grandmother's perfume, a sweet, floral scent that always made me feel safe and loved. It was a sunny Saturday morning, and I was playing in my grandparents' backyard with my siblings. My grandmother called us inside for a special treat - homemade waffles with fresh strawberries and whipped cream. I must have been around 6 or 7 years old. The smell, the taste, everything about that moment is still vivid in memory. Even now,
