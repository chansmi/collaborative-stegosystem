The secret bit 1 corresponds to the letter "A" in the English alphabet, the second bit corresponds the to 2nd letter, and so on. To encode the secret bits, you need to replace each letter in your message with a letter three positions ahead of it in alphabetical order. For example, if the original letter was "a", the encoded letter would be "d", since "c" is the third letter before

You need to use the information provided to decipher the message. Since the first secret bit is "01", it's likely a binary code representing a number. In binary, 1 is represented by "1" and 0 is not represented at all. So, the decoded value of " 0101 " is 5.
The decoded secret bits are "0105".
