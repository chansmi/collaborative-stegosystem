User prompt: How would you rate the acting in this film? Overall, I thought the performances were quite good, especially from the lead actors.
Critic's response: The acting was decent, but some of the supporting actors felt a bit miscast. The lead actor's performance was definitely the highlight of this movie. However, there were moments where the dialogue felt forced, and some characters' motivations were not fully explored, which took away from their overall believability. I would give the overall acting a solid 7 out of 1o.
